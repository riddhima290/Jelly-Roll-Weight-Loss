        <h1>Jelly Roll Weight Loss Tips</h1>
        <p>People love being fit and healthy but many people struggle to maintain a fit lifestyle due to busy routine or procrastination. An unfit body often shows up in forms like excess amount of body fat. So this blog is all about jelly roll weight loss with tips to reduce it. There are five lifestyle habits one must adapt in order to reduce body fat.</p>

        <h2>1. Intermittent Fasting</h2>
        <p>INTERMITTENT FASTING means eating only during certain hours of the day and fasting during the rest. It follows the 16:8 rule: 16 hours of fasting and an 8-hour eating window. It gives your body time to rest and BURNS FAT. It works by giving your body a break from eating so it can use stored fat for energy instead of constantly burning food. When you fast insulin level drops, which helps fat burning, body repairs cells and improves metabolism and your body eats fewer calories overall, leading to fat loss. This is also one of the faster ways to fat loss.</p>

        <h2>2. Yoga</h2>
        <p>YOGA is a part of physical activity pyramid that can be done anywhere with no equipment required. It is quite easier and comforting for beginners to follow. There are various asanas (postures) that can directly reduce fats, for instance, USTRASANA (CAMEL POSE) reduces belly fat, jelly rolls and waist fat. When you bend backwards in ustrasana, it STRETCHES your STOMACH, WAIST, and HIPS AREA. This engages your core and side muscles, which tones the waistline and reduce fat over time. Similarly, there are loads of GENTLE YOGA POSTURES one must try, especially beginners, to get rid of fat.</p>

        <h2>3. LISS Cardio</h2>
        <p>LISS CARDIO means LOW-INTENSITY-STATE cardio, a type of cardio where you move slowly and steadily for a long time to burn fat. It involves walking, cycling, or swimming. When you move at steady pace, your body uses STORED FAT for energy, over time, this helps reduce overall BODY FAT, including jelly rolls and belly fat. It also improves stamina and keeps your heart healthy.</p>

        <h2>4. Crunch Gym</h2>
        <p>CRUNCH GYM is a global fitness chain known for its fun, inclusive, and no judgement approach. It offers group classes, cardio & strength equipment, recovery amenities, and online workouts. Crunch Gym can help reduce jelly rolls by combining cardio exercises, strength training, and guidance from trainers. Cardio like running, cycling, or HIIT helps burn overall body fat. Strength and core exercises, such as planks and twists, tone the waist and belly area. With regular workouts and proper guidance, you exercise effectively, and when combined with a healthy diet, it can gradually reduce jelly rolls.</p>

        <h2>5. No Junk Food Snacks and Unnecessary Stress</h2>
        <p>Everyone is familiar with how junk food increases weight and provides unnecessary fat. Hence, avoid junks and eat only healthy, low-calorie meals. The other hidden factor that contributes to weight gain is stress. Stress can lead to weight gain because it raises the hormone cortisol, which encourages the body to store fat, especially around the belly. It can also increase appetite, making people crave high-calorie or sugary foods. Stress often reduces motivation to exercise, so fewer calories are burned, and it can disturb sleep, which is linked to gaining weight. Managing stress through relaxation, regular exercise, and healthy eating can help prevent this type of weight gain.</p>
