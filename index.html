It can also increase appetite, making people crave high-calorie or sugary foods. Stress often reduces motivation to exercise, so fewer calories are burned, and it can disturb sleep, which is linked to gaining weight. Managing stress through relaxation, regular exercise, and healthy eating can help prevent this type of weight gain.</p>
